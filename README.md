# aws_guardduty_terraform
This project provisions a **security-focused AWS lab** entirely through Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and AWS CLI validation.   It is adapted from a manual AWS lab and rebuilt to follow **AWS Well-Architected best practices**, with a focus on **security-by-design**, repeatability, and event-driven incident response.
